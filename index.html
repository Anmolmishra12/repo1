    Shiva is a major Hindu deity, often called the "destroyer" or "transformer" within 
    the Trimurti (the Hindu trinity with Brahma and Vishnu). He is a complex figure, 
    embodying both benevolent and fierce aspects, and is associated with destruction,
     regeneration, yoga, meditation, and the arts.
